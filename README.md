# GIT Homework

This serves as practice for the GIT training in testing academy.

Some of the challenges I've faced and the things I've learned while working on this homework:

-I tried to commit a change without a message and I ignored the terminal which prompted me to add one. After that I tried to commit again, but with a message this time, and I got an error which generally occurs when you execute two git commands simultaneously.
I had to search it up and solve the issue by deleting the index.lock file, releasing the active lock.

-Also added Intelij temp files into the gitignore file

-Added the ssh key to my ssh agent and also to my keychain, the latter caused me some issues because I didn't know I also have to add it to my keychain in order to work

-Learned that I can call my remote repo by any name I wish so I named it githw instead of origin just so I can get a better grasp of how the flow is working and what things are affected by my actions
